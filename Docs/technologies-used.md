# Server and Server-side Frameworks

### AWS EC2, Node.js, Express.js

We will use AWS EC2 to deploy a Node.js server with Express.js.

We chose Node.js as it has a large and active community which is a huge advantage for support. Additionally, we will be using React for our web application and therefore, it makes sense for us to build our backend with JavaScript as well. 

We chose Express because it has a lot of open-source libraries for common tasks (routing, authentication, and so on) which would be at our disposal. Express is also easy to learn and has a large community around it. Some of our group members also have experience with Express, which will help us get started.

Because of the popularity of Node.js and Express there is an abundance of learning material, from documentation to tutorials, that we can take advantage of.

 

# Data Storage

### MySQL

A relational database fits our app well as there are relatively clear relationships in our app - a rigid design will not impair our development. Additionally, relational databases are fast performing, which is important for the time-saving vision of our app. 

We chose MySQL because it is open source, it is easy to use, and it has a large community, so finding solutions to problems will be fairly easy. Integrating MySQL with our Node server is also straightforward due to the many modules available.

 

# Targeted Platforms

### Web and Android 

A web app is essential as it is versatile and can be used by anyone regardless of whether they are on a PC, a laptop, an Android phone or an iPhone. We decided to build an Android app as well since most of us use or own an Android phone.

 

# Client-side Web Frameworks

### React

We decided on React due to its popularity and marketability as a skill. A couple of points in favour of using React:

- On Stack Overflowâ€™s developer survey, React was the most loved framework for 2019. 
- Gaining knowledge in React would also mean we have a basis for writing applications in React Native, another marketable skill. 
- React has lots of documentation and a few people on the team have some experience using React - they can get us started and help the rest of us if need be.
- React encourages easy to create and reusable components, a pattern that those of us who have used React or similar frameworks find valuable.

 

# Programming Languages

### Backend, web: JavaScript, ReactJS

### Android: Java

 

# Mobile Application Technologies

### Android Studio

We chose Android Studio as it is officially supported by Google - this means that it is both a desirable skill for future native development and that it has a relatively large community and good documentation. Additionally, most of us know how to use it from previous experiences, such as from COMP 3350, which makes ramp-up take less time so we can focus more on programming the actual application.
