# Vision
For students and work groups, make scheduling meetings less time consuming for all party members.



# Motivation

Our motivation came out of our own struggles to find a time to all meet up. We are building this software in hopes that scheduling meetings becomes easier for others. 

Although there are similar products in the market, these do not ultimately select or even list good meeting times. In these applications, it is up to the group to review all possible meeting times and select a final meeting time. Our application will provide the most optimal time for all group members to meet up. Our application also alleviates the time burden from the organizer - it distributes the responsibility among all team members by allowing each group member to fill in their own availability and having the application calculate the optimal meeting time(s).



# Success Criteria

The following are our two success criteria:

* Decrease the overall time spent on determining a meeting time by at least 50%

* Decrease an individualâ€™s time spent on inputting their availability by at least 50%


We consider the project successful if it meets at least one of the two success criteria. 

For example, it took our group (10 members) 20 minutes to find a time that works for the majority of our members. We would like to decrease that time to 10 minutes or less.
