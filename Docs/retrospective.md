# Retrospective

This retrospective was performed for the last month of development.



## What went well

- Communication and collaboration
  - People helping each other out
    - Everyone is willing to help
  - Team work
  - Everyone is friendly and communicative
- Getting more stories done as time progresses
- Client and server setup
- Feature and code review system
- Everyone on the team is very open and agreeable



## What didn't go so well

- Project pacing
  - Could have done more at the start of the project
  - I think sometimes it can be unclear for some people on what to do and hard to jump into a framework that is very different from their previous experience they have done before. If we started learning the framework sooner or assign tasks to people so that people feel that they are important to the group for handling tasks assigned, things might have gone differently.
- Steep learning curve
  - Setting up environments and fixing all the errors that occur in this setup can take a whole day of development or more, even with help
  - Initial learning of several languages, frameworks and libraries leads to making simple mistakes and/or taking a lot of time on simple tasks
- Work distribution at the beginning
  - Not everyone started early to work on the project
  - Some people have worked more on the project than others
  - Needed more guidance on how things worked
- Lack of consistency between mobile and web
- Our MVP/earliest usable product is quite large so we have not yet defined a working release as certain components are dependent on features that are not yet implemented
- This is the case with all group projects, but communication could have been done better early on. I don't think anyone is to blame for lapses in communication. As with many group projects, there are many implicit expectations we individually have that might not get fulfilled and that's okay. All part of the learning process.



## Steps to take

- Setup a "stand-up" channel in Slack. 
  - Our Trello can be hard to navigate and is a lot of information to take in. Having it in Slack gives us a quick point of viewing and since a lot of our discussion already happens on Slack, a place to quickly discuss and address blockers.
- Make smaller pull requests.
  -  Smaller PRs make it easier to review and understand code, which can help acquaint everyone to different areas of the code base. Smaller PRs also update everyone sooner on the work that is being done.
- Continue asking for help and collaborating.



## What we have learned for future projects

- We should have made more effort to invest time into peer programming sessions earlier on, particularly regarding project and CI/CD setup. 
  - We saw it as a waste of time/something that would delay development, as a lot of us had no experience in project/backend setup areas. Unfortunately, the decision to leave these responsibilities to only a couple of people led to:
    - Untapped developer time as devs waited for setup to be done
    - A lot of us did not feel invested in the project early on
    - Once setup was ready, those of us who hadn't participated had a steep learning curve and took a long time to get settled into coding features
  - Peer sessions (with the less knowledgeable leading the coding) we did recently proved that although some developer time is not maximized in the short run, it works out better in the longer run.
- We should have attempted to define a smaller MVP/earliest usable/testable product. 
  - With this, it would have been easier to define smaller, more meaningful, and more concrete tasks to each person in the group. It might have also increased developer investment in the project and provided a sense of accomplishment and progress throughout. 
  - Defining a smaller MVP could have also provided us a chance to establish earlier and more concrete deadlines to measure our progress and motivate those of us who like working towards a deadline.
