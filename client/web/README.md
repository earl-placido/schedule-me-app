# Introduction
Our project will run reactJS inside a docker container. Docker helps to keep the same environments throughout different machines just like Python virtual environment. This helps because different machines/dependencies might have a different way of running code and might causes the automated build/tests to fail. We use docker instead of a virtual machine because docker just creates the minimal requirements for the app instead of having to create different features just to run the operating system. 

A great image explanation between the comparison of VM and docker:
