# Final Retrospective

This retrospective was performed at the end of the project.



## What went well

- More communication 

  - communicated more often when we needed people to review PRs
  - weekly meetings made us more on top of things and allowed us to communicate with each other and give ideas/feedback/perspectives/ideas
  - the standup channel on Slack has been a nice way to keep up with what everyone is doing

- Smaller PRs

  - PRs are more manageable when they are smaller
  - PRs are much easier to review 
    - easier to change things up front 

- We have ramped up that curve!

- For the most part we've finished the MVP

  

## What didn't go so well

- Moments in which only the same couple of people were reviewing PRs
  
  - people's schedules can be very different due to other classes and available hours
  
  

## If we were to start over, we would:

- Change our startup process to get everyone more involved
- Do a lot more work early on
- Start testing sooner
  - We were a little rushed for time in the testing portion
- Set leadership sooner and assign smaller tasks/work more at the beginning to make sure everyone was working on something meaningful every week
